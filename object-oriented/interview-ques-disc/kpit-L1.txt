what is the difference between oops in c++ and in general oops concepts ?



In general, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts refer to 
a programming paradigm that 
emphasizes the use of objects and classes to organize code and data. 
OOP concepts are not tied to any specific programming language.

C++ is an object-oriented programming language, and it implements 
the OOP concepts such as 
encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. 
However, there are some differences between OOP in C++ 
and OOP in general:

1. Multiple inheritance: C++ supports multiple inheritance, 
which allows a class 
to inherit from more than one base class. 
This is not supported in all OOP languages.

2. Virtual functions: C++ supports virtual functions, 
which allow a function to be overridden 
by a derived class. This is a powerful feature of C++ 
that is not found in all OOP languages.

3. Templates: C++ supports templates, which allow for generic programming. 
This is a feature that is not found in all OOP languages.

4. Pointers: C++ allows the use of pointers, which can be a powerful tool 
for implementing OOP concepts,
but can also be a source of bugs and errors if not used carefully.

In summary, while the core OOP concepts are the same across 
different programming languages, 
the specific implementation of these concepts in C++ may differ 
from other OOP languages 
due to features unique to C++.

in c++ how and when vtable is created


In C++, the virtual function table (V-table) is created 
by the compiler at compile-time.

The V-table is created for each class that has at least one virtual function, 
and it contains an entry for each virtual function in the class. 
The entries in the V-table are ordered according to the order 
in which the virtual functions are declared in the class.

Each entry in the V-table is a function pointer that points 
to the appropriate virtual function 
implementation for that class. When a virtual function is called 
on an object, the runtime system uses 
the object's V-table pointer to locate the appropriate virtual function 
implementation in the V-table 
and calls it.

The V-table is initialized when an object is created and 
its constructor is called. 
The constructor initializes the V-table pointer 
to point to the V-table of the object's class. 
If the object is a derived class object, the V-table pointer 
is updated to point to the 
derived class V-table after the 
derived class constructor is called.

It's important to note that the exact details of V-table creation and initialization may vary 
depending on the compiler and platform being used. However, the general process described 
above is how virtual function dispatch typically works in C++.

IN HOW MANY WAYS WE CAN CREATE THREADS IN C++

1. USING std::thread class , we can create its object , pass function 
2. USING PTHREAD API , create pthread_t (thread handle) and call function
    pthread_create -->pass thread handle and function

WHAT IS pthread_t

`pthread_t` is a data type defined in the POSIX threads (pthread) library, 
which is a C library for creating and managing threads in a portable and standard way across 
different platforms. 

In the pthreads library, a `pthread_t` data type is used to represent a thread identifier, 
which is an opaque object that identifies a thread. It is used to manage and control a thread, 
such as starting, stopping, joining, or detaching the thread.

When a new thread is created using the `pthread_create()` function, it returns a `pthread_t` object 
that represents the new thread. This object is used to control and manipulate the thread by passing 
it as a parameter to other pthread functions like `pthread_join()`, `pthread_detach()`, or 
`pthread_cancel()`.
